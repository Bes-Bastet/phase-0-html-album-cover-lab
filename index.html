    <!--There has been an issue running the rspec test through this lab.  The HTML has been validated with W3C and does not diplay coding errors.  The rspec test does not appear to recognise the span tags.  The span does render in Chrome and matches the mockup (as much as it is possible).  The two spans and logos are encased in one <p></p> element to match the back album cover mockup.  Various iterations were tried, but to no avail the second span element is not recognised in the respec test. 28/07 one change made to make sure the css was being picked up correctly - think something might have been incorrectly introduced so that the 'style.css was not being recognised' -->
